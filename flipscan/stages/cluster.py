"""Stage 4: cluster — group frames into page identities.

What real footage taught us (dense text pages defeat perceptual hashing —
same-page and different-page distances overlap):

- WITHIN a video, the reliable page-boundary signal is a TURN EVENT: a
  sustained run of high-motion frames. Segments separated by a real turn are
  different pages; separated by a brief wobble, the same page.
- ACROSS videos, the reliable identity signal is the PRINTED PAGE NUMBER read
  at transcription. Videos' page sequences are simply concatenated here;
  after transcription, pages sharing a printed number are deduplicated (best
  capture wins) and everything is ordered by number. So you can keep adding
  videos until every page is covered.
- A capture that shows an open two-page spread yields ONE page: the vision
  model is instructed to transcribe only the flat, readable side (the curled
  side gets its own flat capture in another pass and dedupes by number).
  With [preprocess] split_spreads on, select later splits captures of a flat
  spread into a left and a right page instead.
