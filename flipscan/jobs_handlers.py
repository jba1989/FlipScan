#            one at a time so they never race manifest.json or flood the model.
#   proof  — chapter proofreads. Each writes its own per-chapter file, so they
#            run several at once.
#   import — PDF/video ingest. No LLM; a same-project import can't overlap that
#            project's pipeline (blocked by the 409 gate), so this lane runs
#            independently of `main` — an import never waits behind another
#            book's pipeline.
#   tts    — audiobook synthesis. Serial, and its own lane so an hours-long
#            narration neither blocks nor waits behind OCR work. (Both use the
#            GPU: run a pipeline and an audiobook at the same time only if your
