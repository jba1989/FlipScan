"""Generate a narration voice from a text description (Parler-TTS).

Chatterbox clones voices from reference audio but can't invent one from words.
Parler-TTS (Apache-2.0) can: it synthesizes speech whose speaker matches a
natural-language description ("an elderly male speaker with a deep, gravelly
voice, speaking slowly and formally"). We use it to mint a ~20 s generic voice
sample per character from the cast analysis's description, drop it in the
shared voice library, and let Chatterbox clone it for the actual narration.

Parler conditions on voice ATTRIBUTES (age, gender, pitch, pace, tone) — it
does not know or imitate real people, so a description mentioning a famous
name only contributes its adjectives.
